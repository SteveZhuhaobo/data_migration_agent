- [ ] Test package installation from built artifacts

## Quick Pre-Publication Commands

Run these commands to verify everything is ready:

```bash
# 1. Clean and test everything
make clean
make ci

# 2. Test fresh setup (in temporary directory)
cd /tmp
git clone /path/to/your/repo databricks-mcp-server-test
cd databricks-mcp-server-test
python scripts/setup_dev.py
make dev-full

# 3. Test publication process
python scripts/test_publication.py https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/databricks-mcp-server.git

# 4. Final validation
make clean build test-install test-uvx validate-dist
```

## Publication Steps

Once all checklist items are complete:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Create repository on GitHub
# Clone locally and add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/databricks-mcp-server.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Test with Publication Script
```bash
# Test the complete process
python scripts/test_publication.py https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/databricks-mcp-server.git
```

### 3. Verify GitHub Actions
- Check that workflows run successfully
- Verify all checks pass
- Review any generated artifacts

### 4. Test Installation
```bash
# Test from different environments
# Windows, macOS, Linux if possible
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/databricks-mcp-server.git
cd databricks-mcp-server
python scripts/setup_dev.py
make dev-quick
```

## Success Criteria

The project is ready for publication when:

- ✅ All checklist items are completed
- ✅ `python scripts/test_publication.py` passes all tests
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows run successfully
- ✅ Package can be built and installed on multiple platforms
- ✅ Documentation is complete and accurate
- ✅ Fresh environment setup works reliably

## Post-Publication

After successful publication:

1. **Create a release** - Tag version and create GitHub release
2. **Test public access** - Verify others can clone and use
3. **Gather feedback** - Share with community for testing
4. **Iterate** - Improve based on user feedback
5. **Consider PyPI** - Publish to PyPI for wider distribution

This checklist ensures your project is robust, well-documented, and ready for public use.
