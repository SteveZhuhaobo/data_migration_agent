# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms existing MCP servers for Snowflake, Databricks, and SQL Server into reusable, distributable packages that can be easily installed and configured by other users. The goal is to create production-ready MCP server packages that follow industry standards for Python package distribution, configuration management, and deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to install MCP servers via pip, so that I can quickly add database connectivity to my MCP-enabled applications without building from source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `pip install mcp-snowflake-server` THEN the system SHALL install the Snowflake MCP server package with all dependencies
2. WHEN a user runs `pip install mcp-databricks-server` THEN the system SHALL install the Databricks MCP server package with all dependencies  
3. WHEN a user runs `pip install mcp-sql-server` THEN the system SHALL install the SQL Server MCP server package with all dependencies
4. WHEN installation completes THEN each package SHALL provide a command-line entry point for starting the server
5. WHEN packages are installed THEN they SHALL be available in the user's Python environment without additional setup

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure MCP servers using environment variables and config files, so that I can securely deploy them in different environments without hardcoding credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a server starts THEN it SHALL read configuration from environment variables as the primary method
2. WHEN environment variables are not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to reading from a configuration file
3. WHEN configuration includes database credentials THEN the system SHALL validate connection parameters before starting
4. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages indicating what needs to be fixed
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading without requiring a restart
6. WHEN sensitive credentials are used THEN the system SHALL never log or expose them in plain text

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy MCP servers using Docker containers, so that I can run them in containerized environments with consistent behavior across different platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Docker image is built THEN it SHALL contain the MCP server and all required dependencies
2. WHEN a container starts THEN it SHALL accept configuration through environment variables
3. WHEN a container runs THEN it SHALL expose the MCP server on a configurable port
4. WHEN container health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL respond with server status
5. WHEN containers are deployed THEN they SHALL support orchestration platforms like Kubernetes and Docker Compose
6. WHEN containers restart THEN they SHALL automatically reconnect to configured databases

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an MCP client developer, I want consistent APIs across all database MCP servers, so that I can write generic code that works with multiple database types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to any MCP server THEN the system SHALL provide standardized tool names for common operations
2. WHEN executing queries THEN all servers SHALL return results in a consistent format
3. WHEN listing database objects THEN all servers SHALL use the same naming conventions for tools
4. WHEN errors occur THEN all servers SHALL return error messages in a standardized format
5. WHEN server capabilities are queried THEN all servers SHALL report their features using the same schema
6. WHEN authentication fails THEN all servers SHALL handle and report authentication errors consistently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database user, I want to authenticate using multiple methods, so that I can connect using the authentication system that matches my organization's security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Snowflake THEN the system SHALL support username/password, key-pair, and SSO authentication
2. WHEN using Databricks THEN the system SHALL support personal access tokens and OAuth authentication
3. WHEN using SQL Server THEN the system SHALL support Windows authentication, SQL authentication, and Azure AD authentication
4. WHEN authentication credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL establish a secure connection to the database
6. WHEN connection pools are used THEN the system SHALL manage authentication tokens and refresh them as needed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating MCP servers, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can quickly understand how to configure and use each server type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is accessed THEN it SHALL include installation instructions for each platform
2. WHEN configuration examples are provided THEN they SHALL cover all supported authentication methods
3. WHEN troubleshooting guides are available THEN they SHALL address common connection and configuration issues
4. WHEN API documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include examples of all available tools and their parameters
5. WHEN getting started guides are available THEN they SHALL include working examples that can be copy-pasted
6. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL be versioned and match the corresponding package version

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want automated testing for all MCP servers, so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN automated tests SHALL run for all affected components
2. WHEN tests execute THEN they SHALL cover connection handling, query execution, and error scenarios
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL use mock database services to avoid external dependencies
4. WHEN performance tests execute THEN they SHALL validate response times and resource usage
5. WHEN security tests run THEN they SHALL verify credential handling and input validation
6. WHEN test results are available THEN they SHALL be reported with clear pass/fail status and coverage metrics

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a package maintainer, I want automated CI/CD pipelines, so that I can reliably build, test, and publish new versions of MCP server packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the CI pipeline SHALL automatically run all tests
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL build distributable packages for PyPI
3. WHEN Docker builds are triggered THEN the system SHALL create and tag container images
4. WHEN releases are tagged THEN the system SHALL automatically publish packages to PyPI and Docker registries
5. WHEN builds fail THEN the system SHALL notify maintainers with detailed error information
6. WHEN security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them before deployment

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As an end user, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can diagnose and resolve issues when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them with appropriate severity levels
2. WHEN connection failures happen THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages
3. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL specify exactly what needs to be corrected
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL support verbose logging modes
5. WHEN logs are written THEN they SHALL include timestamps, severity levels, and contextual information
6. WHEN sensitive information is logged THEN it SHALL be redacted or masked appropriately

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want secure credential management, so that my database credentials are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credentials are stored THEN they SHALL be encrypted at rest
2. WHEN credentials are transmitted THEN they SHALL use secure protocols (TLS/SSL)
3. WHEN environment variables contain secrets THEN they SHALL not be logged or exposed in error messages
4. WHEN configuration files contain credentials THEN the system SHALL warn about file permissions
5. WHEN credential validation fails THEN error messages SHALL not reveal credential details
6. WHEN servers shut down THEN they SHALL clear credentials from memory
