# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables automated migration of data from on-premises SQL Server databases to Snowflake, specifically focusing on migrating the customers and orders tables to the steve_mcp database in the data_migration schema. The migration process will enhance the data with metadata columns to track migration status and timestamps.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to migrate customers and orders tables from SQL Server to Snowflake, so that I can consolidate data in the cloud platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration process is initiated THEN the system SHALL connect to both SQL Server and Snowflake databases
2. WHEN reading source data THEN the system SHALL retrieve all records from the customers table in SQL Server
3. WHEN reading source data THEN the system SHALL retrieve all records from the orders table in SQL Server
4. WHEN creating target tables THEN the system SHALL create tables in the steve_mcp.data_migration schema in Snowflake
5. WHEN creating target tables THEN the system SHALL preserve all original column structures and data types
6. WHEN inserting data THEN the system SHALL transfer all source data to the corresponding Snowflake tables

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to add migration metadata to migrated records, so that I can track which records have been migrated and when.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating target tables THEN the system SHALL add an is_migrated column with INTEGER data type
2. WHEN creating target tables THEN the system SHALL add a migrated_at column with TIMESTAMP data type
3. WHEN inserting migrated records THEN the system SHALL set is_migrated to 1 for all records
4. WHEN inserting migrated records THEN the system SHALL set migrated_at to the current timestamp
5. WHEN the migration completes THEN all migrated records SHALL have both metadata columns populated

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want the migration process to handle errors gracefully, so that I can identify and resolve issues during data transfer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connection failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
2. WHEN data type mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL log specific conversion errors
3. WHEN the migration fails THEN the system SHALL rollback any partial changes in Snowflake
4. WHEN the migration completes successfully THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to validate the migration results, so that I can ensure data integrity and completeness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration completes THEN the system SHALL compare record counts between source and target
2. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL verify that all metadata columns are properly populated
3. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL check for any data truncation or corruption
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed discrepancy reports
5. WHEN validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL confirm successful migration completion
