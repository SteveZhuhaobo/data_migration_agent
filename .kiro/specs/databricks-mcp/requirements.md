# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Databricks operations, similar to the existing SQL Server MCP but tailored for Databricks environments. The MCP server will enable users to interact with Databricks clusters, execute SQL queries, manage tables, and perform data operations through a standardized interface. The server will read configuration from the existing config/config.yaml file and provide comprehensive Databricks functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect to Databricks using configuration from config.yaml, so that I can establish secure connections without hardcoding credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN it SHALL read Databricks configuration from config/config.yaml
2. WHEN establishing a connection THEN the system SHALL use server_hostname, http_path, and access_token from the config
3. WHEN the config file is missing THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
4. IF catalog and schema are specified in config THEN the system SHALL use them as defaults for operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to execute SQL queries on Databricks, so that I can retrieve and analyze data from my data lakehouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a SELECT query THEN the system SHALL return results with column names and data
2. WHEN I execute DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) THEN the system SHALL return affected row counts
3. WHEN I execute DDL operations (CREATE, DROP, ALTER) THEN the system SHALL return success confirmation
4. WHEN a query fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error information
5. WHEN executing long-running queries THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to explore database schemas and tables, so that I can understand the data structure in my Databricks environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request to list catalogs THEN the system SHALL return all available catalogs
2. WHEN I request to list schemas THEN the system SHALL return schemas for a specified catalog
3. WHEN I request to list tables THEN the system SHALL return tables for a specified catalog and schema
4. WHEN I request table schema information THEN the system SHALL return column names, data types, and constraints
5. WHEN I request to describe a table THEN the system SHALL return detailed table metadata

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to manage tables in Databricks, so that I can create and modify data structures as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a table THEN the system SHALL execute the CREATE TABLE statement successfully
2. WHEN I drop a table THEN the system SHALL execute the DROP TABLE statement with confirmation
3. WHEN I create a table with partitions THEN the system SHALL support partition specifications
4. WHEN I create external tables THEN the system SHALL support location and format specifications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to insert data into Databricks tables, so that I can populate tables with structured data programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide data as JSON objects THEN the system SHALL insert the data into the specified table
2. WHEN inserting multiple rows THEN the system SHALL handle batch operations efficiently
3. WHEN data types don't match THEN the system SHALL return clear validation errors
4. WHEN insertion succeeds THEN the system SHALL return the number of rows inserted

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to work with Databricks notebooks and jobs, so that I can execute and monitor data processing workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I list jobs THEN the system SHALL return available Databricks jobs
2. WHEN I run a job THEN the system SHALL trigger job execution and return run ID
3. WHEN I check job status THEN the system SHALL return current execution status
4. WHEN I list clusters THEN the system SHALL return available compute clusters
5. WHEN I check cluster status THEN the system SHALL return cluster state information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses
2. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear connectivity error messages
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return authentication-specific error details
4. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL handle throttling gracefully
5. WHEN operations timeout THEN the system SHALL return timeout-specific error information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to follow the same patterns as the existing SQL Server MCP, so that I have a consistent interface across different data platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL implement the same MCP protocol structure as SQL_MCP.py
2. WHEN tools are listed THEN the system SHALL return tool definitions in the same format
3. WHEN tools are called THEN the system SHALL handle arguments and return responses consistently
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return error responses in the same JSON format
5. WHEN successful operations complete THEN the system SHALL return success responses with consistent structure
