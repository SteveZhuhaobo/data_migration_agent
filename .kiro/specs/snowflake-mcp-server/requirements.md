# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides integration with Snowflake, enabling users to interact with Snowflake databases, warehouses, schemas, and data through a standardized MCP interface. The server should provide similar capabilities to the existing Databricks and Fabric MCP servers, allowing users to execute queries, manage data, and interact with Snowflake resources programmatically.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to connect to Snowflake through an MCP server, so that I can access Snowflake resources using standardized MCP tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is configured with Snowflake credentials THEN the system SHALL establish a secure connection to Snowflake
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages indicating the authentication issue
3. WHEN the connection is established THEN the system SHALL be able to list available databases, schemas, and warehouses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute SQL queries against Snowflake databases, so that I can retrieve and analyze data programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid SQL query is provided THEN the system SHALL execute the query against the specified Snowflake database
2. WHEN query execution is successful THEN the system SHALL return the results in a structured format
3. WHEN a query fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error information including error codes and messages
4. WHEN query execution times out THEN the system SHALL handle the timeout gracefully and return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to list and explore Snowflake resources (databases, schemas, tables, warehouses), so that I can understand the available data structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting database information THEN the system SHALL return a list of accessible databases
2. WHEN requesting schema information THEN the system SHALL return available schemas within a database
3. WHEN requesting table information THEN the system SHALL return available tables within a schema
4. WHEN requesting warehouse information THEN the system SHALL return available warehouses and their status
5. WHEN requesting table schema information THEN the system SHALL return detailed column information and data types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to manage data in Snowflake databases, so that I can create tables and insert data for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new table THEN the system SHALL create the table with specified columns and data types
2. WHEN inserting data into a table THEN the system SHALL validate data types and insert the records
3. WHEN data insertion fails THEN the system SHALL return specific error messages about validation failures
4. WHEN table creation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP server to handle authentication securely, so that Snowflake resources are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring authentication THEN the system SHALL support multiple authentication methods (username/password, key pair, OAuth)
2. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms and not log sensitive information
3. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh tokens when possible
4. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully
4. WHEN the system encounters unexpected errors THEN it SHALL return user-friendly error messages while logging technical details

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the MCP server to provide similar functionality to the existing Databricks and Fabric MCP servers, so that I have a consistent experience across different data platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the Snowflake MCP server THEN the system SHALL provide equivalent tools to the Databricks and Fabric MCP servers where applicable
2. WHEN executing queries THEN the system SHALL return results in the same format as other MCP servers
3. WHEN managing tables THEN the system SHALL provide similar create, insert, and schema operations
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL use consistent error response formats

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to manage Snowflake warehouses, so that I can control compute resources for query execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN listing warehouses THEN the system SHALL return warehouse names, sizes, and current status
2. WHEN starting a warehouse THEN the system SHALL initiate warehouse startup and return status
3. WHEN stopping a warehouse THEN the system SHALL suspend the warehouse and confirm the action
4. WHEN getting warehouse status THEN the system SHALL return current state and resource usage information
