# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a containerized Docker solution for the Snowflake MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, similar to the existing SQL Server MCP containerization. The solution will package the Snowflake MCP server into a Docker container with proper configuration management, connection testing, and deployment scripts to enable easy distribution and deployment across different environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the Snowflake MCP server in a Docker container, so that I can deploy it consistently across different environments without worrying about Python dependencies or environment setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I build the Docker image THEN the system SHALL create a container that includes all necessary Python dependencies for the Snowflake MCP server
2. WHEN I run the Docker container THEN the system SHALL start the Snowflake MCP server and make it available on a configurable port
3. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL validate that all required environment variables are present
4. IF required environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages indicating which variables need to be set

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Snowflake connection parameters through environment variables, so that I can deploy the same container image across different environments with different Snowflake instances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I set Snowflake connection environment variables THEN the system SHALL use these to connect to the specified Snowflake instance
2. WHEN connection parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about the connection failure
3. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL validate the Snowflake connection before starting the MCP server
4. IF the Snowflake connection fails THEN the system SHALL exit with a non-zero status code and log the connection error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated scripts to build, run, and test the Snowflake MCP Docker container, so that I can easily manage the containerized deployment without memorizing complex Docker commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the build script THEN the system SHALL create a Docker image with the Snowflake MCP server
2. WHEN I run the deployment script THEN the system SHALL start the container with proper port mapping and environment variable configuration
3. WHEN I run the test script THEN the system SHALL verify that the container is running and the MCP server is responding correctly
4. WHEN any script fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and exit with appropriate status codes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can understand how to configure, deploy, and troubleshoot the containerized Snowflake MCP server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for building and running the Docker container
2. WHEN I need to configure the container THEN the system SHALL provide examples of all required and optional environment variables
3. WHEN I encounter issues THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance for common problems
4. WHEN I want to integrate with existing systems THEN the system SHALL provide examples of how to use the containerized MCP server

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the containerized Snowflake MCP to follow the same patterns as the existing SQL Server MCP container, so that I have a consistent experience across different MCP server types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I compare the Snowflake and SQL Server MCP containers THEN the system SHALL use similar directory structures and file naming conventions
2. WHEN I use either container THEN the system SHALL provide similar command-line interfaces and configuration approaches
3. WHEN I deploy either container THEN the system SHALL use consistent port mapping and environment variable patterns
4. WHEN I troubleshoot either container THEN the system SHALL provide similar logging and error reporting mechanisms
