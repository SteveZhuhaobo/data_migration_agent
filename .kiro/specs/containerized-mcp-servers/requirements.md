# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a containerized distribution system for three existing MCP servers (Snowflake, Databricks, and SQL Server). Each server will be packaged into separate Docker images that can be deployed to container registries like GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) or Docker Hub, allowing easy deployment and usage across different environments without affecting the existing codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to package each MCP server into separate Docker containers, so that I can deploy them independently without dependencies on the current project structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packaging the servers THEN the system SHALL create separate folder structures for each MCP server (Snowflake, Databricks, SQL Server)
2. WHEN creating the folder structure THEN the system SHALL copy all necessary files without modifying the original source files
3. WHEN building containers THEN each server SHALL have its own isolated environment with all required dependencies
4. IF a server has configuration files THEN the system SHALL include template configurations in the container

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want each MCP server to have its own Dockerfile and build configuration, so that I can build and deploy them independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating Docker configurations THEN each server SHALL have its own optimized Dockerfile
2. WHEN building images THEN the system SHALL use appropriate base images for Python applications
3. WHEN configuring containers THEN each SHALL expose the necessary ports for MCP communication
4. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL include all Python dependencies and requirements files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to easily run any MCP server from a Docker image, so that I can use these servers on any machine with Docker installed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running a container THEN the user SHALL be able to start it with simple docker run commands
2. WHEN starting a server THEN it SHALL accept configuration through environment variables
3. WHEN deploying THEN each container SHALL include comprehensive documentation for usage
4. IF configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear examples and templates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want each containerized server to have proper documentation and build scripts, so that the distribution process is automated and reproducible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the distribution THEN each server SHALL have a README with usage instructions
2. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL provide build scripts for automation
3. WHEN documenting THEN each server SHALL include configuration examples and troubleshooting guides
4. WHEN preparing for distribution THEN the system SHALL include docker-compose examples for easy deployment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the containerized servers to be publishable to public registries, so that I can easily pull and use them from GitHub Container Registry or Docker Hub.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing for publication THEN each image SHALL be properly tagged with version information
2. WHEN publishing THEN the system SHALL support pushing to multiple container registries
3. WHEN distributing THEN each image SHALL include proper metadata and labels
4. IF publishing to GHCR THEN the system SHALL include GitHub Actions workflows for automated builds
