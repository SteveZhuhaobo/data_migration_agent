# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides integration with Microsoft Fabric, enabling users to interact with Fabric workspaces, lakehouses, warehouses, and data through a standardized MCP interface. The server should provide similar capabilities to the existing Databricks MCP server, allowing users to execute queries, manage data, and interact with Fabric resources programmatically.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to connect to Microsoft Fabric through an MCP server, so that I can access Fabric resources using standardized MCP tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is configured with Fabric credentials THEN the system SHALL establish a secure connection to Microsoft Fabric
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages indicating the authentication issue
3. WHEN the connection is established THEN the system SHALL be able to list available workspaces and resources

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute SQL queries against Fabric warehouses and lakehouses, so that I can retrieve and analyze data programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid SQL query is provided THEN the system SHALL execute the query against the specified Fabric resource
2. WHEN query execution is successful THEN the system SHALL return the results in a structured format
3. WHEN a query fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error information including error codes and messages
4. WHEN query execution times out THEN the system SHALL handle the timeout gracefully and return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to list and explore Fabric resources (workspaces, lakehouses, warehouses), so that I can understand the available data structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting workspace information THEN the system SHALL return a list of accessible workspaces
2. WHEN requesting lakehouse information THEN the system SHALL return available lakehouses within a workspace
3. WHEN requesting warehouse information THEN the system SHALL return available warehouses within a workspace
4. WHEN requesting table schema information THEN the system SHALL return detailed column information and data types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to manage data in Fabric lakehouses and warehouses, so that I can create tables and insert data for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new table THEN the system SHALL create the table with specified columns and data types
2. WHEN inserting data into a table THEN the system SHALL validate data types and insert the records
3. WHEN data insertion fails THEN the system SHALL return specific error messages about validation failures
4. WHEN table creation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP server to handle authentication securely, so that Fabric resources are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring authentication THEN the system SHALL support multiple authentication methods (service principal, user credentials)
2. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms and not log sensitive information
3. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh tokens when possible
4. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully
4. WHEN the system encounters unexpected errors THEN it SHALL return user-friendly error messages while logging technical details

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the MCP server to provide similar functionality to the existing Databricks MCP server, so that I have a consistent experience across different data platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the Fabric MCP server THEN the system SHALL provide equivalent tools to the Databricks MCP server where applicable
2. WHEN executing queries THEN the system SHALL return results in the same format as the Databricks server
3. WHEN managing tables THEN the system SHALL provide similar create, insert, and schema operations
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL use consistent error response formats
