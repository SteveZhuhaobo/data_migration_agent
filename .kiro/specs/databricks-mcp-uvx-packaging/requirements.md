# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves restructuring the existing Databricks MCP server to be packaged and distributed using uvx instead of Docker containers. The goal is to simplify deployment and sharing by allowing users to install and run the MCP server with just uv/uvx and credential configuration, eliminating the need for Docker setup and container management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to install the Databricks MCP server using uvx, so that I can quickly set it up without Docker dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `uvx databricks-mcp-server` THEN the system SHALL install and start the MCP server
2. WHEN the package is installed THEN it SHALL include all necessary Python dependencies
3. WHEN uvx installs the package THEN it SHALL be available as a standalone executable
4. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL work identically to the current Docker-based version
5. IF uv/uvx is not installed THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation instructions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to share the Databricks MCP server with my team using a simple uvx command, so that everyone can use it without complex setup procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I share the uvx command THEN team members SHALL be able to install it with one command
2. WHEN team members run the command THEN they SHALL get the same version and functionality
3. WHEN updates are released THEN uvx SHALL handle version management automatically
4. WHEN sharing with external teams THEN they SHALL only need uv/uvx and credentials
5. WHEN the package is distributed THEN it SHALL not require any Docker knowledge

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure the Databricks MCP server using environment variables or config files, so that I can set up credentials without modifying code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I set environment variables THEN the system SHALL read Databricks credentials from them
2. WHEN I provide a config file path THEN the system SHALL read configuration from that location
3. WHEN both environment variables and config files exist THEN environment variables SHALL take precedence
4. WHEN credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about required configuration
5. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate and report specific issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want the MCP server to be packaged as a proper Python package, so that it follows standard Python packaging conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is created THEN it SHALL include a proper pyproject.toml file
2. WHEN dependencies are specified THEN they SHALL be clearly defined with version constraints
3. WHEN the package is built THEN it SHALL include all necessary files and modules
4. WHEN installed via pip/uvx THEN it SHALL create proper entry points for the executable
5. WHEN the package is published THEN it SHALL be installable from PyPI or similar repositories

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the uvx-packaged MCP server to maintain the same functionality as the Docker version, so that I don't lose any capabilities during migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the uvx version THEN it SHALL provide all the same MCP tools as the Docker version
2. WHEN I execute queries THEN the results SHALL be identical to the Docker version
3. WHEN I manage tables and schemas THEN all operations SHALL work the same way
4. WHEN errors occur THEN error handling SHALL be consistent with the Docker version
5. WHEN connecting to Databricks THEN authentication and connection logic SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation on how to use the uvx-packaged MCP server, so that I can quickly get started and configure it properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look for installation instructions THEN the documentation SHALL provide clear uvx installation steps
2. WHEN I need to configure credentials THEN the documentation SHALL show all supported configuration methods
3. WHEN I want to use it with Kiro THEN the documentation SHALL provide MCP configuration examples
4. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the documentation SHALL include common problems and solutions
5. WHEN comparing to Docker version THEN the documentation SHALL explain the differences and migration path

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the uvx package to handle dependencies and environment setup automatically, so that deployment is reliable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uvx installs the package THEN it SHALL create an isolated environment with correct dependencies
2. WHEN Python versions differ THEN the package SHALL specify compatible Python version requirements
3. WHEN dependencies conflict THEN uvx SHALL resolve them within the isolated environment
4. WHEN the server runs THEN it SHALL not interfere with other Python packages on the system
5. WHEN uninstalling THEN uvx SHALL cleanly remove all package files and dependencies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want the packaging structure to support easy development and testing, so that I can contribute improvements and fixes efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I clone the repository THEN I SHALL be able to run the server locally for development
2. WHEN I make changes THEN I SHALL be able to test them before packaging
3. WHEN building the package THEN the process SHALL be automated and reproducible
4. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL validate both local and packaged versions
5. WHEN releasing updates THEN the versioning and publishing process SHALL be streamlined
